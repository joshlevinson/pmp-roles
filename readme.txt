Adds a WordPress Role for each Membership Level.

== Description ==

Adds a new WordPress Role for each Membership Level. A member's role will be set to the role for their membership level after checkout.

Custom roles will set the `display_name` as the membership level's name and the `role` as `pmpro_role_x`, where `x` is the membership level's ID. 

Custom role capabilities are equivalent to WordPress `subscriber` role capabilities. You can adjust the role's capabilities using the `pmpro_roles_default_caps` filter in a custom function. For a list of all WordPress core capabilities, visit (https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/).

Alternately, you can use a plugin like [User Role Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) to add or remove custom capabilities via a settings page in the WordPress dashboard.

The plugin will immediately create a new role for every existing or newly added membership level. 

* New members will have their role set after completing checkout. 
* Existing members will keep their previous role. You will need to perform a custom database query to bulk update the roles for existing members, if desired.

If you no longer want to use this plugin, click the "Delete and Deactivate" link in the plugin's action links on the Plugins page in the WordPress dashboard. This will update all users with a custom membership role and set their "role" back to the WordPress "subscriber" default.

This plugin currently requires Paid Memberships Pro. 

Based on the original PMPro Roles plugin by Josh Levinson (josh@joshlevinson.me) in 2013.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `pmpro-roles` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. That's it. No settings.
